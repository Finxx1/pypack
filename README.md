# pypack
Bad Python packager.

## Usage
Pypack is built with the Slate build tool, see [here](https://finxx.xyz/slate.html)

Pypack will run a python file with the same name as the executable, so if Pypack is named "example.exe", it will run "example.py"

Pypack looks in the pypack.json file to get information on what dependencies are needed.

See the build/ directory for examples.
